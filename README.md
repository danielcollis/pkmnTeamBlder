This is a simple webpage that aims to make it easy for the user to see how their Pokemon team matches up to all of the types in the game.
Using the dropown menus, users can select a Pokemon (Gen 5) from their team, then that Pokemon's sprite will appear on the chart and their types will be calculated against all the others.
Once all team members have been selected, the team's total weaknesses and resistances to each type will be displayed on the rightmost columns of the table.

This is primarily to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and interaction with REST API.
